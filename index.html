    <h1> CSS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h1><br>
    <b>Ques 1.What is box sizing ?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        -Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element. <br>
        -Default value of box-sizing is content-box, in this case the actual width of the box<br>
         will be equal to the border and padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width<br>
         + border + padding ).<br> 
         In case when box-sizing is set to be border-box, then the actual width will be equal<br>
         to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of,<br>
         the box then it will not increase the width of the box.
    </p><br><br>

    <b>Que 2.What is animation delay ?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        -It is a sub-property of CSS animation. It defines how long the animation has to<br>
         wait before starting. Using the animation-delay property, you define the delay by<br>
         specifying the number of seconds or milliseconds it should take before playing.
    </p><br><br>

    <b>Que 3.Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid ?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        grid-column-start and grid-column-end property can be used to merge cells<br>
        vertically. It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-column: start/end. If you want to merge<br>
        two elements in row then we will have to use grid-row property inside the child<br>
        element. Remember these properties are applicable only to child elements not to<br>
        parent elements.
   </p><br><br>

   <b>Que 4.Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid ?</b>
   <p>Ans.<br>
       grid-row-start and grid-row-end property can be used to merge cells horizontally. It<br>
       also has a shorthand i.e., grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;
   </p><br><br>

   <b>Que 5.Explain CSS box model</b>
   <p>Ans.<br>
       The box model in CSS is a set of rules that determine how your web page is<br>
       rendered on the internet. In this model, a rectangular box is generated for HTML<br>
       elements. This box consists of first content, then padding, then border, and finally<br>
       margin.
  </p><br><br>

    <b>Que 6.what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden ?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <b>display: none;</b><br>
          -The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It<br>
           does not   take up any space.<br>
          -In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements<br>
           to fill in.<br>
       <b>visibility: hidden;</b><br>
          -The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout<br>
           i.e., it takes up the space.<br>
          -The element is hidden from view but not the page flow.
